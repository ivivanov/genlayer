## Dependencies

## Explanation

## Assumptions
I assume the task is to find the fastest path from 'A' to 'B' in directional weighted graph. The type of graph can be determined by the adjacency list in the example:
directional - because A has B as neighbor but B does not have A listed
weighted - because latency can be represented as edge weight
